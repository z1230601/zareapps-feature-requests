# Feature Description
Describe the feature and its purpose in a big picture. Feel free to describe and highlight things from the problem statement. 

## Non Depicted Use Cases
Describe as much as possible certain use cases you would like to have depicted. 
Some Guidlines: 
* First things first - focus on happy paths (vanilla cases) and describe how you would like the system to behave.
* Focus - Try to focus on the important things like the jist and the effect, do not waste time describing color profiles page setups or button placement
* For Whom am I doing this? - Think of different actors if necessary
* Murphy's law - Finally think also of non happy paths and describe what you would expect to happen if something is not possible
* [Optional] For 1+ students - Write the use cases in a syntax which forces you to think things through like Gherkin but can also be different linguistical frameworks.

## Beta testers
Reference users or email addresses which would be willing to beta test or join/watch public reviews.
